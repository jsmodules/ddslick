About this plug-in:

- Adds images and description to html `select` elements
- Allows JSON to populate the drop down options
- Converts your HTML select element to ddSlick
- Uses minimal CSS, no external stylesheets to download.
- Supports callback functions on selection
- Works without images or description

With traditional drop downs i.e. using `<select><option></option></select>` you
are limited to only text and value. But with this easily configurable jQuery
plug-in, you can now create a custom drop down that can very well include
images, a short description, along with your usual text and value.
